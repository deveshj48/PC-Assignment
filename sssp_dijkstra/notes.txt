some notes so far:

- for MPI, 
    -since the adjacency matrix is symmetric, we can use for scatterv or similar function that allows for diff
        amounts of data to be sent, eg page 5 lecture 9 example 1
    - perhaps use derived datatype
    - note all-to-one reduction (pg 6 of assignment brief)

- for general parallel implemenation, look at parallel formulation
    of Prim's algo in the textbook


things to try in openMP sssp:
- put the "#pragma omp parallel" inside the while loop
- try to get rid of the 1 big "omp for"
- check speedup, etc
- CURRENT OPENMP IMPLEMENTATION IS WRONG

improved on:
- used reduction for openmp, but changed to using local vars and critical
