some notes so far:

- for adjacency matrix, change text file name in both the getVertEdg() and setupGraph() functions
- for MPI, 
    -since the adjacency matrix is symmetric, we can use for scatterv or similar function that allows for diff
        amounts of data to be sent, eg page 5 lecture 9 example 1
    - perhaps use derived datatype
